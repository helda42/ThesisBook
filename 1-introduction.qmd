## Non-typhoidal Salmonella Epidemiology and Pathology

### Epidemiology

#### Global incidence and burden of disease

Non-typhoidal *Salmonella (*NTS) infections are an important cause of enterocolitis in high income settings, which is usually self-limiting with an estimated global disease incidence of 95 million cases in 2017, but with a low case-fatality rate [@stanaway_global_2019-1]. However, non-typhoidal Salmonella can cause serious life-threatening disease through invasion of the bloodstream, meninges and other normally sterile sites, with a high case-fatality rate (14·7%) [@marchello_incidence_2021]. NTS are a leading cause of bacteramia in sub-Sarahan Africa [@marchello2019]. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study, there were an estimated 535,000 invasive NTS illnesses, resulting in 77,500 deaths in 2017 [@stanaway_global_2019-1] . The majority of these invasive disease episodes and deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (422,000 & 66,500 respectively) [@stanaway_global_2019-1]. A recent systematic review reported overall age-standardised incidence rates of 7.5 per 100,000 person-years in 2017, with the highest incidence in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounted for almost 80% of all cases of iNTS globally with an incidence of 34.5 per 100,000 person years [@marchello_incidence_2021]. The burden of NTS diarrhoeal disease has been estimated by the GBD (2019) to be responsible for 40,000 deaths annually [@gbdresu]; 8% of all hospitalised diarrhoeal illnesses. However, these estimates of pathogen-specific diarrhoeal deaths use estimates from studies employing molecular diagnostics to identify pathogens associated with diarrhoeal disease deaths, from the proportion of diarrhoeal illnesses needing hospitalisation. In low-resource settings, it is often the case that these deaths occur in the absence of access to care [@raghunathan2019], therefore clinic or hospital based data may suffer from selection bias and may not reflect the true distribution of pathogens causing diarrhoeal deaths. As a result GDB 2019 adjusted the estimates for any studies with data not collecting outpatient or community-based samples. Studies from diarrhoeal aietiology studies in low-resource settings suggest that the proportion of diarrhoea attributable to NTS could be much lower [@liu2016], with estimates ranging from 1% from the Global Paediatric Diarrhoea Surveillance Network [@cohen2022] using a broad assay for all *Salmonella* enterica, and 1% in the Global Enteric Multicentre Study (GEMS) [@kotloff_incidence_2019] for children with moderate to severe diarrhoea, and 2% of those hospitalised.

#### Nomenclature and serovars

NTS includes all serovariants of *Salmonella* *enterica* species excluding subspecies *Salmonella* Typhi and *Salmonella* Paratyphi A, B and C. *Salmonella* has a broad host range, and commonly transmissed via contaminated food and water. NTS are facultive anaerobes and are predominantly intracellular organisms. *Salmonella* Typhimurium (Group B *Salmonella*, O:4/O:4,5, H1-i) and *Salmonella* Enteritidis (Group D *Salmonella*, O:9, H1-g/m) are the two main serovars globally causing invasive disease. The serovar Salmonella Typhimurium has been found to account for 77%, and Salmonella Enteritidis for 17% globally of NTS invasive infections on a recent systematic review [@marchello_incidence_2021], with a range of other serovars accounting for the remainder. There are a wide range of other serovars documented to be associated with invasive disease in humans [@tbl-serovars]. Specific lineages, such as *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhimurium sequence type ST313 lineages I and II, has caused large epidemics of NTS bacteraemia [@feasey_three_2015, @kingsley_epidemic_2009]. Within *Salmonella* Enteritidis subspecies, the ST11 'Africa-restricted clades' (Central and East African lineages) are the predominant casuses of bacteriamia [@kariuki_antimicrobial_2015, @feasey2016].

![Serovars associated with invasive disease table taken from systematic review of incidence of invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella [@marchello_incidence_2021]](1_images/serovars_marchello.png){#tbl-serovars width="439"}

#### Age-Distribution

Invasive disease is predominantly seen in HIV-infected adults and children under 5 years with recent malaria, malnutrition or anaemia [@feasey_invasive_2012-1, @crump_epidemiology_2015]. The highest incidence of iNTS disease globally is seen in children under 5 years in SubSaharan Africa?? 34·3 (23·2 to 54·7) per 100,000, reaching up to 150 (110-230) cases per 100,000 population in neonates and infants in sub-Saharan Africa [@stanaway_global_2019-1] . Globally the highest incidence is in children younger than 5 years of age (1), with a peak of disease in one endemic area in Malawi at around 13 months of age (6). In Sub-Saharan Africa overall, the incidence is highest in the under 5 age group, after which it falls significantly (figure 2). However, there is a doubling from baseline incidence by 35-44 years of age, which is likely to reflect the impact of high HIV prevalence on iNTS disease. Mean all-age case fatality rate was 14.5% in 2017, but higher in high-risk groups, including 13.5% in those aged \<5yrs with the highest estimated mortality in \>70yrs with HIV infection (75.7% mortality). It is estimated that each death due to iNTS disease results in 72 years of life lost (YLL) resulting in overall 4.26 million YLLs in 2017 (1). Comparatively, although typhoid and paratyphoid fever are more common; in 2017 there were 14.3 million cases vs 535 000 of iNTS, there were only double the number of deaths (136,00 vs 77,500), illustrating the greater severity and case-fatality associated with iNTS disease. The burden of disease is in Sub-Saharan Africa where access to healthcare, particularly amongst groups at high risk, is patchy. Invasive NTS disease is also associated with poor nutritional status, younger age, immune-suppression and severe malarial anaemia (1). infants, the elderly and immune-compromised most at risk (7).

### Sources and modes of transmission

In high-income countries strains of NTS are transmitted predominantly through the food chain, contaminated by animal faeces. Modes of transmission of non-typhoidal Salmonella in low and middle-income countries are not as well understood. It it likely that humans are an important reservoir for the strains of NTS associated with invasive disease. There have been a number studies attempting to identify animal and environmental reservoirs of invasive NTS strains; we reviewed 14 recent studies across multiple settings in sub-Saharan Africa that employed molecular methods able to identify sub-clades/ subtypes of NTS [@chirwa2023]. We found there is a good evidence that NTS subtypes associated with invasive disease are not found in the domestic environment, and found household studies of iNTS index cases have identified matching isolates in household members. Further research is required to demonstrate that transmission can occur between household members.

### Asymptomatic carriage and household transmission

It is key to understand patterns of human carriage, and shedding of NTS strains in stool, to be able to understand the potential human transmission dynamics. We have used the terms invasive (iNTS), diarrhoeal (dNTS) and enteric infection (eNTS) without disease (asymptomatic carriage in stools) [@tbl-phenotypes], and described the hypothesised relationship between these clinical phenotypes in taken our review [@fig-phenotypes, @chirwa2023]. Comparison of children with iNTS in a Kenyan age-matched case-control study with diarrhoeal NTS (dNTS) and asymptomatic stool shedding (eNTS), demonstrated a high degree of similarity between isolates from iNTS, dNTS and eNTS.

: Definition of non-typhoidal *salmonella* clinical phenotypes @chirwa2023

:::

Systemic natural protective immunity to iNTS, which is largely acquired between 6 months - 3 years in Malawi, develops following exposure of the GI tract to Salmonella. A longitudinal study of a cohort of 50 healthy Malawian children, who were sampled monthly, showed that between the ages of 6-18 months more than 50% had at least one episode when a non-typhoidal strain of Salmonella was detected in their stool. Most of these episodes were not associated with current or recent diarrhoea. In any month, there was an 8-9% chance of stool positivity for *Salmonella*. Quantitative PCR using a pan-Salmonella marker (TTR, tetrathionate reductase gene) was more sensitive than culture for detection. Among samples that were culture-positive, 48% of isolates comprised ST313 S. Typhimurium, with the remainder being a wide range of non-typhoidal serovars that are not seen from blood cultures in Malawi (unpublished work T. Nyirenda).

![A schematic diagram of the known sources of diarrheal nontyphoidal Salmonella (dNTS) infection, and the 2 hypothesized sources of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections. Option 1 for iNTS infections, highlighted in red, is that Salmonella from an animal reservoir colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract, leading to enteric nontyphoidal Salmonella (eNTS). Option 2 is that the source of infections leading to eNTS exposures are other humans with intestinal colonization of nontyphoidal Salmonella. In either case, once eNTS is established, there are 3 outcomes that can follow: (i) no active infection, just colonization; (ii) dNTS; or (iii) iNTS disease.

### Clinical features of invasive disease

#### Clinical spectrum of disease, diagnostics and management

NTS in immunocompetent individuals generally results in self-limiting enterocolits, and presents with gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhoea and crampy abdominal pain. Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) usually presents with a non-specific illness with predominant fever and can be challenging to differentiate from other causes of fever from history and examination alone, particularly where recent or acute malaria is common [@gilchrist_invasive_2019], and can commonly present in the absence of a history of diarrhoea [@feasey_invasive_2012]. Diagnosis can only be made on microbiological culture [@feasey_invasive_2012-1]. The ability of health facilities to diagnose iNTS based on blood cultures, is limited across sub-Saharan Africa, and tends to only be available in wealthier, urban areas, which may not capture the areas with highest burden of disease. Many severely ill children are treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

#### Antimicrobial resistance

Emergence of antimicriobial resistance of invasive NTS strains to many antimicrobial classes is a major concern [@tack2020]. Resistant infections are associated with poor clinical outcomes. *Salmonella* Typhimurium sequence type ST313 lineages I and II, and *Salmonella* EnteritidisST11 Central and East African lineages are associated with resistance to multiple classes of antibacterials including multidrug resistance (MDR) to first line agents (co-resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol), third-generation cephalosporins and fluroquinolones [@kingsley_epidemic_2009, @kariuki_antimicrobial_2015, @tack2020]. Azithromycin resistance has been reported in DR Congo [@tack2020]. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins has emerged in all Sub-Saharan African regions, and was found to be present in 5% (95% CI 1-10%) after 2010 [@tack2020]. Azithromycin may be an alternative where AMR is high. However, there is a lack of data on the efficacy of antibiotic therapies for iNTS and no evidence-based internation guidelines.

#### Evolution and host adaptation

#### ST313 emerged – immune niche, genome degradation, special intracellular adaptation (Jay)

A novel Salmonella serovar Typhimurium multilocus sequence type ST313 has been described and dominates the invasive infection across much of sub-Saharan Africa (8). There has been no proven zoonotic source of ST313 infections, and human to human transmission has been postulated (4). Two clonal lineages of S. Typhimurium ST313, named I and II have spread sequentially across Sub-Saharan Africa in the past 40 years, with lineage II being dominant within the last decade (4, 9, 10). The success of these pandemics has been largely attributed to antibiotic resistance within these lineages, and the emergence of HIV (1, 11). ST313 is associated with multi-drug resistance to chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and ampicillin (2, 3, 12). Furthermore there have been alarming reports of acquired ESBL plasmids within ST313 conferring additional resistance to Ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, rendering these invasive infections virtually untreatable with currently available antibacterial drugs (1, 9).

#### Invasion of the gut HIV/ Child

Infectious *Salmonella* are ingested and some are able to survive the acidic gastic acid and outcompete gut microbiotia. *Salmonella* are able to invade non-phagocytic cells, such as enterocytes or microfold (M) cells in the Peyer's Patches, allowing them to breech the intestinal epithelium. The *Salmonella* Pathogenicity Island (SPI-10T3SS) codes for the expression of the Type III Secretion System (T3SS): a syringe-shaped multi-protein complex with ring structures in the inner and outer bacterial membranes with a central conduit that enables translocation of effector proteins from the bacteria to into the host cell [@deng2017] . Salmonella can also be phagocytised by CD18+ intestinal macrophages or taken up by dentritic cells (DCs) [@khan2014] . Salmonella use many strategies to evade the host immune defense including interfering with the DC-mediated antigen presentation or disrupt the phagosome function [@khan2014]. Macrophages and DCs allow Salmonella to disseminate through the bloodstream to distant tissues in the host, including spleen, liver and bone marrow [@gordon] . In incompetent hosts, Salmonella infections remain localised in the small intestine and colon [@khan_non-typhoidal_2010], and generally results in a self-limiting enterocolitis.

#### Intra and extracellular periods of life cycle

#### PGTE – complement resistance

### Immunopathogenesis

#### Antibody as part of extracellular and intracellular host response

Following gut invasion, the Salmonella enter the bloodstream, where they are vulnerable to antibody attack. Bacteria can be lysed in the blood by antibody and complement dependent serum bactericidal activity (SBA) (@fig-intrextrAb: A). When Salmonella reach the extra-intestinal tissues, they are engulfed by phagocytes following antibody opsonisation, and efficiently killed (@fig-intrextrAb: B). Some bacteria manage to evade killing and can infect the phagocyte forming a primary infection foci where bacteria are protected from antibodies (@fig-intrextrAb: C); most bacterial growth occurs intracellularly. The primary infection spreads to infect polymorphonuclear phagocytes (PMN) and mononuclear cells, but number of bacteria remains low per host cell (@fig-intrextrAb: D). Salmonella are spread via the bloodstream to different organs. Some bacteria escape the intracellular foci and either sucumb to antibody and complement mediated lysis by SBA or rapidly infect local cells, or travel to distant sites to establish new foci (@fig-intrextrAb: E).

![Pathogenesis of Salmonella includes of intracellular growth phase and extracellular spread.

#### Function of Ab as correlate of protection vs burden of disease

### Host immune response and susceptibility factors

#### Maternal immunity

Maternal antibody appears to be protective in infants [@maclennan_neglected_2008, @nyirenda_sequential_2014, @de_alwis_role_2018], when serum bactericidal activity is tested

#### The acquisition of natural systemic immunity

We have described the age-stratified sequential acquisition of CD4 cellular immunity, followed by functional antibody-mediated immunity and serum bactericidal activity against iNTS among children in Malawi  (6). This demonstrated the nadir of functional humoral immunity, which occurs after the waning of maternal antibody, but before the sequential acquisition of first cellular immunity, then anti-LPS IgG antibody and associated functional serum bactericidal activity (SBA). This nadir coincides with the peak incidence of iNTS disease among children at 9-13 months (figure 6.), further demonstrating how a serological protective threshold of humoral protection develops following eNTS exposure over time.

Robust defense against iNTS required both cellular and humoral immunity, and we have previously demonstrated both cellular and humoral defects that cause susceptibility to iNTS disease. Humoral and cellular defences have both been shown to be impaired in current and recent uncomplicated malaria (figure 7.). Bound, complement-opsonised antibody is required both for serum bactericidal activity, and for uptake of bacteria by phagocytes prior to killing by respiratory burst.

Recent evidence suggests that complement depletion during current or recent falciparum malaria could contribute to both immune defects. Nyirenda *et al.* have observed transient loss of Serum Bactericidal Activity (SBA) during and after uncomplicated malaria in Malawian children, which is also associated with a transient reduction in complement C3b binding (29). In addition, we have described that invasive African ST313 *S.* Typhimurium  strains have a single nucleotide non coding promotor-region mutation that causes an 11-fold increase in expression of PgtE, a virulence factor in African *S.* Typhimurium, which disrupts the complement cascade by increasing the degradation of the factor B component of human complement, thus contributing to serum resistance (30). This suggests that evasion of complement-mediated serum killing may be one key bottleneck evolutionary point for invasive African strains. Though transient, lasting just a few weeks, malaria-associated consumptive complement deficiency could exert an important effect in at a population level in settings such as Southern Malawi, where approximately 50% of children cross-sectionally surveyed are rapid diagnostic test-positive for malaria during the rainy season (31).

There are critical current knowledge gaps in our understanding of the relationship of enteric Salmonella exposure and the development of protective immunity amongst those in the highest risk age bands; of what are the correlates of protection for iNTS disease; and of how the effect of known susceptibility risk-factors in different populations affect these relationships.

Several mechanisms of humoral and cellular immunity are required for protection against iNTS disease, and different risk factors act on different elements of the immune response. This means that some of the resultant background immunological susceptibilities might be fully vaccine-responsive (eg a lack of sufficient protective antibody), while others might not be fully ameliorated by vaccine-induced immunity (eg periods of complement deficiency, or failure of respiratory burst due to haemosiderin damage to phagocytes). This means that the potential impact of vaccine deployment to prevent iNTS disease might be different in different epidemiological settings.

Understanding these influences will ultimately allow us to understand the effects of specific known risk factors, and to describe antibody correlates of protection. This will allow us to accelerate vaccine licensure and deployment, and to model predicted vaccine impact among different susceptible populations in sub-Saharan Africa.

#### Model of exposure and immunity

We therefore present a theoretical framework (figure 8) for asymptomatic enteric infection with NTS (eNTS) among Malawian children, followed by the development of first antigen-specific cellular immunity, and then functional systemic immunity. Systemic immunity is evidenced by the presence of anti-Salmonella LPS IgG antibody (αLPS IgG) which, when combined with complement opsonisation, results in functional protection, reflected in serum bactericidal activity (SBA). This is likely to be influenced by several factors including social factors such as poverty and sanitation, by seasonal climatic conditions through the year, and by the impacts on immune status of malaria, malnutrition and anaemia. There is likely to be interaction between several of these influencing risk factors.

![Theoretical framework for a model of exposures and protection in iNTS disease](1_images/Theoretical_framework.jpeg){width="650"}

CoPs have been strengthened for other vaccines using animal models, or by the use of Controlled Human Infection Models (CHIM). However, the role of these models is very limited in iNTS disease – animal models fail to accurately recapitulate the multiple and complex levels of susceptibility among children at risk of iNTS disease, and development of a CHIM for iNTS disease is not likely possible or ethical, because of the essential role of significant immunocompromise to permit invasive disease, and the associated severity and high case fatality. This strengthens the need for a comprehensive understanding of the epidemiological settings, and a full understanding of both serological and functional correlates.

Generally, a defined antibody cut-off is used as a CoP. Humoral immunity may or may not, however, represent the true mechanism of protection. If the measured immune endpoint can be demonstrated to be closely associated with the causal mediator of protection it can still provide a useful tool for assessing protection (16). The mechanism of immunity developed as a result of natural immunity is often the same as vaccine induced immunity, in terms of functional antibodies. However, the protective threshold may differ according to qualitative characteristics of the antibody (15). In addition to simple high through-put measures of function, such as a SBA bactericidal assay, a systems serology discovery approach can therefore play a key role in understanding the mechanism of protection, how this relates to the proposed correlate of protection, and how variation in antibody characteristics may play a role in influencing the level of protection.

#### Host susceptability factors

iNTS disease has a bimodal age distribution in sub-Saharan Africa, being commonest in adults with HIV, and in young children (18), among whom the median age of invasive disease is 13 months (figure 4) (6). iNTS disease is linked to several underlying susceptibilities among children, particularly recent malaria, severe malarial anaemia and malnutrition (19). The attributable fraction of disease in children from each of these susceptibilities are unknown (ongoing work). Children, particularly between the ages of 6 months to 2 years are particularly at risk, suggesting protection before 6 months by breastfeeding and transferred maternal antibody (20, 21).

HIV infection in both adults and children is a risk factor for iNTS disease, although more so in adult populations (18), with over 95% of cases in adults being associated with HIV infection compared with 20% among pediatric cases in the pre-ART era. Acute malnutrition is also associated with iNTS disease in African children with an OR for disease amongst Kenyan children of 1.68 (1.15-2.44) (22). Seasonality of iNTS disease is well recognized, coinciding with the rainy season (7, 12). This may reflect a number of risk factors changing with seasons, including food availability and malaria risk.  A genome-wide association study in Kenya and Malawi has shown an association with a STAT4 locus which is linked to reduced interferon-γ production by NK cells (23).

The epidemiological data, however, consistently implicate malaria as the commonest risk factor with a large effect-size adjusted OR: 4.13 (2.66–6.44) (24). Recent uncomplicated malaria, acute severe malaria and severe malarial anaemia are particular phenotypes specifically associated with an increased risk for iNTS disease (7, 18, 25). Two different estimates have suggested that malaria is a key contributing factor in 50-70% of cases of iNTS disease (26, 27) and the negative association of malaria with an HbAS (sickle cell trait) genotype has been used to demonstrate the contribution of malaria risk to invasive bacterial disease (26). It is not clear how malaria exerts this effect – possible mechanisms include haemolysis and impairment of cellular defence because of haemosiderin-laden macrophages; the effects of malaria on the gut microbiota causing impaired mucosal defence; an altered and suppressed inflammatory cytokine environment with raised IL-10; and transient complement depletion. We have reviewed these possibilities in Nyirenda *et al* (2018) (28).

#### Malaria

**Introduction:** Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease is a high-burden disease of African children, with highest incidence in children under 5 years (1,2). The World Health Organization (WHO) recognises iNTS as a top-10 vaccine priority for Africa. Understanding the role of maternally acquired immunity in protection against invasive disease is vital in understanding natural protection against invasive disease and guiding vaccine strategies, including considerations for the potential role for maternal vaccines. Malaria has been associated with increased risk of developing invasive NTS disease in children (3,4), which has been proposed to impair the innate, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against NTS (5,6). Immunoglobulin-gamma (IgG) antibodies against NTS lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have been associated with protection against iNTS (7), and are being currently investigated as a potential correlate of protection for clinical vaccine trials.

However, little attention has been paid to the role malaria may have on maternally acquired immunity. Placental malaria has been associated with impaired transplacental transfer of antibodies to a range of vaccine preventable infections (8–13), although the association has been inconsistent across studies. The seroepidemiology in Africa of iNTS study has recruited mother and infant pairs from areas of varying malaria transmission intensity in southern Malawi, which has shown infants under 4 months from high malaria transmission areas have lower S. typhimurium O-antigen immunoglobulin-gamma (IgG) concentrations than infants from low malaria transmission areas. This important finding requires further study to collect further meta-data on other potential confounding factors and to test additional samples from a separate cohort of mother and infant pairs with known malaria status, to validate this finding.

**Background:** Placental malaria ^8–10,14,15^, HIV ^8–13^ and hypergammaglobulinemia have been shown to impair transplacental IgG transfer for a range of vaccine preventable infections ^16^ including measles and tetanus antibodies ^14^, influenza ^10^, RSV ^17^, group B Streptococcus ^13^,

Across a range of studies HIV-positive pregnant women have been shown to have lower pathogen-specific antibody titres during pregnancy compared to HIV-negative pregnant women, as well impaired transplacental transfer, with resulting lower mean cord-to-maternal titre ratios (CMR), lower mean antibody concentration and/or higher proportion of infants below protective antibody thresholds compared to infants of HIV-negative women^8–13^. One proposed mechanism is impaired maternal immunity leading to lower maternal antibodies. HIV impacts B-Cell activity and maternal immune response to infection and vaccination but has also been shown to cause inflammation of the placenta which may impact antibody transfer. Hypergammaglobulinemia has also been linked to reduction in transplacental transfer of antibodies. Both HIV and malaria have been associated with B-cell defects including overproduction of total IgG through polyclonal B-cell activation ^18,19^.

Findings have been less consistent between the association of malaria in pregnancy with impaired transplacental transfer compared to the associations seen with HIV, from studies showing strong associations of lower infant pathogen-specific antibody levels for measles, varicella, Hib, *S*. pneumoniae, and tetanus ^8–10,14,15^, but not seen with influenza ^10^ and variable association seen in RSV  ^20^.

Placental malaria may impair antibody transfer directly due to parasitic infection at the placental interface through inflammation, interference with placental architecture impacting on surface area which can additionally lead to intrauterine growth restriction and pre-term birth ^21^. Similarly to HIV, hypergammaglobulinaemia appears to play a key role ^17,22^. A Gambian study found both hypergammaglobulinaemia of pathogen-specific antibodies and placental malaria were associated with large reductions in transplacental antibody transfer measles antibody, but not tetanus antibody ^14^. The same Gambian study found placental malaria specifically impaired the transfer of IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4, but not IgG3 ^23^, whereas maternal hypergammaglobulinaemia impaired transfer of only IgG1, IgG2. It is proposed that in hypergammaglobulinaemic states, high levels of non-specific and low-quality IgG are generated, saturating the finite number of Fc receptors at the placental surface, or outcompeting other IgG with lower affinity for FcRn ^17,23,24^. There is growing evidence that hypergammaglobulinaemia is the underlying mechanism for impaired transplacental transfer of antibodies, which may be independent, or induced by infections such as malaria and HIV, and historical associations of malaria and HIV with reduced antibody transfer may be confounded by hypergammaglobulinaemia ^25,26^.

Unravelling the effects of HIV, placental malaria and hypergammaglobulinaemia from further confounding factors such as geographic location. In settings such as the Gambia, there was a high prevalence of hypergammaglobulinemia and placental malaria ^14,23^ (95% of mothers had both), however in a study in Papua New Guinea only 56% of mothers had both ^27^. In the Papua New Guinea study high maternal total IgG was associated with impaired transplacental transfer of antibodies, however, placental malaria was not, and further analysis supported this finding ^25^. The prevalence of hypergammaglobulinaemia is not well documented, particularly in LMICs, and causes are poorly understood. Hypergammaglobulinaemia is associated with several chronic infections HIV, placental malaria, but also with arsenic exposure ^28^.

Preterm delivery has been associated with reduced transplacental transfer of antibodies for measles, rubella, varicella zoster, mumps, Haemophilus influenzae B (Hib), diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, pertussis, and polio ^29^. Birthweight has also been associated with reduce antibody transfer although the underlying pathophysiology may be multifactorial (associated with preterm birth, placental infection etc). Other factors such as maternal age, weight, parity, type of delivery, nutritional status and smoking status have been evaluated for association with placental antibody transfer, but few have found convincing associations. Only one study found increasing transfer of anti-RSV antibodies with increasing parity.

Few studies have studied the transplacental transfer of NTS-specific antibodies;  in Vietnamese mother-child dyads ^30^, highly efficient transfer of NTS O antigen–specific antibodies was seen. However, this study did not present data on maternal co-morbidities that may impact antibody transfer such as malaria or HIV.

## Public Health interventions for iNTS

Declines in iNTS disease in children have been associated with improvements in malaria control in the Gambia, Kenya, and Tanzania (3,14,15), however, there is uncertainty about whether these associations are causal and therefore the extent to which malaria control will reduce iNTS disease incidence. Several ecological studies have explored associations between host factors and iNTS disease at a population level. Feasey *et al.* [@feasey_modelling_2015] used structural equation modelling to examine associations between malaria, SAM, and HIV with NTS bloodstream infections over a period of 10 years and found that iNTS declined by 11.8% annually over this period, while malaria incidence fell by 36% in the first two years, then stabilised, while admissions for SAM by declined by 5.8% per year. Statistically significant direct effects on iNTS disease from malaria and SAM (regression coefficients 0.56 and 0.20 respectively), as well as direct and indirect effects of HIV on iNTS disease through SAM (0.25 and 1.33 respectively), and indirect effect of rainfall (via effects on malaria and SAM). Declines in iNTS disease during this period may have been associated with successful antiretroviral, malaria, and malnutrition programs. Tack *et al.* (16) used principal components analysis and multivariate time series regression to examine associations of environmental and host factors on the seasonal dynamics of iNTS disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and found significant associations of iNTS disease with SAM with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.01-1.17), malaria and anaemia combined with an IRR of 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 – 1.41), and direct effects of rainfall with an IRR of 1.13 (95% CI 1.04 – 1.21).

## Assessing iNTS disease burden

### Blood culture surveillance

Blood culture remains the gold standard diagnostic method for invasive salmonellosis, and existing surveillance depends on blood culture. Blood culture surveillance depends on clinical presentation to a health facility with blood culture facilities, which depends on health-seeking behaviors and availability of health facilities. Blood cultures demand a microbiological laboratory with sufficient resources, often in wealthier urban settings, and is not available in many parts of the world, particularly in the areas with the most at risk populations in impoverished communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore the disease burden of invasive salmonellosis in many regions of the world is unknown. Blood culture has a high specificity, but a moderate sensitivity, particularly in young children where low sample volumes can reduce the sensitivity further \[ref\]. Exposure to antibiotics prior to having blood cultures taken can reduce sensitivity further. Blood cultures requires venous sampling which can be challenging in infants and people presenting in extremis including shock. There is also a risk of contamination if sterile technique is not observed, which can be challenging in many settings that do not have sufficient resources for hand hygiene and sterile equipment - this can lead to overgrowth with skin contaminants and reduce ability to detect Salmonella??? \[ref\]. As a result blood culture surveillance significantly underestimates the incidence of invasive salmonellosis as illustrated by the surveillance pyramid [@fig-pyramid]. The degree of underestimation of incidence is likely to be much larger in typhoid, compared to iNTS due to the more severe presentation of INTS, and as a result higher presentation to health facilities. However, due to the high case fataility of iNTS, it likely a significant proportion don't make it to health facilities before death, also contributing to underestimation of disease. Hybrid surveillance models have been used to improve population incidence rate estimation, combining facility-based estimates, with community-based health seeking behviour to reported adjusted estimates for typhoid incidence and adjusted for blood culture sensitivity and health-seeking behaviour [@meiring_burden_2021, @andrews2018], however, this has not been done consistently for iNTS due to concerns that health-seeking behaviour has less impact due to the severity of the presentation of iNTS patients, although it is possible there is less severe presentation that does not present to hospital.

Existing estimates of global incidence for iNTS disease have been based on systematic reviews including one carried out within of the Global Burden of Diseases Study (2017) [@stanaway_global_2019-1], which included studies from 1980-2017 that contained information on iNTS disease incidence, defining a case of iNTS disease as culture-confirmed NTS infection of a normally sterile site (eg, blood). A more recent systematic review was conducted by Marchello et al. [@marchello_incidence_2021], funded as part of an EU-funded consortium to develop iNTS vaccines. Stanaway et al. included 35 studies in the incidence estimates, and included hospital or clinic-based studies that made adjustments in their reported estimates for incomplete case finding and to the underlying catchment population. They did not include adjustments for health-seeking behaviour as this data was mainly available from household surveys of milder febrile illnesses. They used a Bayesian methods to fit geographical multi-level models to extrapolate incidence across geographic regions. Highest incidence of disease was reported in sub-Saharan Africa 34·5 (26·6 to 45·0) cases per 100,000, and highest in

Previous data from Malawi has shown that iNTS disease peaked in Malawi in 2002 reaching epidemic incidence of 242 cases per 100,000 population [@feasey_three_2015], and has been steadiliy declining to 6.9 per 100,000 in 2019 [@wilson_incidence_2022].

### Serosurveillance

Serosurveillance measures serological markers in samples collected from a representative population sample, to assess population exposure to a pathogen and susceptability to infection. Serosurveillance has become a powerful tool in the era of multiplex laboratory testing combined with computational modeling, to identify infectious disease threats and guide public health responses [@wiens2022]. This can be particularly informative when assessing vaccine coverage to identify gaps in immunity that might require targeted vaccine campaigns. Seroepidemiology has been used to predict epidemics and inform vaccination strategies for measles and rubella [@winter2018]. For some pathogens such as Hepatitis B, which is asymptomatic in children, serosurveillance is the only method for surveillance and way to evaluate vaccine impact. Assays measuring salivary IgA offer a less invasive sampling method, that is more suitable to assess mucosal responses particularly relevant for gastrointestinal pathogens.

It is important to have high resolution regional data to inform vaccine implementation for both typhoid conjugate vaccines and development and evaluation of iNTS vaccines. Countries require granular evidence of disease burden in order to receive funding support from Gavi the Vaccine Alliance. New approaches have been developed for estimating the burden of typhoid [@aiemjoy_estimating_2022] using IgG against hemolysin E (HlyE) which is a pore-forming toxin produced only by Salmonella typhi and paratyphi, and not found in other Salmonella species, which reduces cross-reactivity that reduces the specificity of other antibody markers such as IgG against LPS. Antibodies detected in individuals in the population represent exposure to a pathogen presenting that specific antigen at some time in the past, regardless of symptoms. Seroprevalance can be measured in a population by carrying out a cross-sectional serosurvey at a single point in time. Seroincidence can be estimated by measuring increases in antibody between two time points, indicating new infections occuring in this period. It can be difficult to define cut-offs to define seropositive and seronegative individuals, as the distribution of antibodies in the population is rarely bimodal, and standard reference cut-off values have not been identified. Waning antibodies over time can contribute to the difficulties in distinguishing between exposed and unexposed individuals. Variation in antibody levels with age make cut-offs even more challenging, particularly in high transmission settings, where children may rapidly reach a plateau of antibody levels in early life [@nyirenda_sequential_2014] due to frequent exposure to pathogens in high transmission settings. If antibodies wane very slowly such as Vi IgG, the seroprevlance will be directly related to the age distribution of the sampled population, with a saturation point being reached, as antibody levels plateau beyond a certain age. This challenge exists to a greater extent with NTS where there are many Salmonella subspecies within the same serogroup not associated with invasive disease, that may induce cross-protection, but will overestimate the exposure to invasive serovars in the population.

Newer techniques have developed for estimating typhoid seroincidence, using antibody decay kinetics in culture-confirmed cases to interpret antibody levels in the population and

Methods to estimate NTS seroincidence in low transmission settings, based on antibody decay profiles in culture-confirmed Salmonella infections have been used in developed countries, where invasive disease is rarely seen [@falkenhorst_serological_2012]. However, this method is more difficult to apply to settings with high force of infection, where antibody levels can quickly reach a saturation point in early childhood. There have been no large-scale community seroepidemiological studies using anti-NTS antibodies. There have been smaller cohorts investigating antibody responses to LPS immunoglobulins in Kenya [@peter2023], Malawi \[\@nyirenda_sequential_2014\] and Uganda [@stockdale_cross-sectional_2019]. Assays have been developed to detect salivary anti-IgA for NTS LPS [@elias].

### Environmental surveillance

Environmental surveillance has been proposed as a method to identify high burden sites for Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (TCV), to complement blood culture and serosurveillance [@andrews_validation_2003]. Environmental surveillance requires the collection of enviromental samples from a range of sources including drinking water, sewage, air, or formites and using microbiological and molecular methods to screen for pathogens. Environmental surveillance has been used in SARS-COV2 to predict outbreaks prior

### Impact of SARS-COV2

COVID-19 has caused substantial disruptions to health care services directly and indirectly across the globe, particularly LIMICs (6), impacting on detection, treatment and prevention of transmission of many infectious diseases. This disruption has resulted from numerous factors including; overwhelmed health care facilities, and laboratory services, health worker sickness and reduced attendance at health facilities (6); due to fear of being infected or prohibitive transport fares due to reduced vehicle capacity under COVID-19 preventive measures. The impact of the pandemic on health was similar across many other countries in the region.  The 2021 WHO Tuberculosis report, highlights a significant decline (18%) in TB case notification rates in the post COVID-19 period, in the context of increasing notification rates between 2017-2019, resulting in an increase of 100,000 of TB deaths between 2019 and 2020 globally (7), and initial modeling suggested this disruption could have long lasting effects resulting in 1.4 million deaths between 2020-2025 (8). A scoping review on the impact of COVID-19 on Malaria in SSA, found overall, fewer countries reporting data during 2020, but overall mixed results with high endemic countries reporting fewer cases, and low endemic countries reporting more cases and deaths (9). A systematic review showed that healthcare utilisation dropped by a third during the pandemic (10).

In Malawi, from the detection of the first COVID-19 case in Malawi till 31 March 2022[\[1\]](#_msocom_1) [\[2\]](#_msocom_2) , there have been a total of 84,475 cases and 2558 deaths reported. Health care in Malawi has been particularly hard hit by the COVID pandemic; an interrupted time series analysis of TB case notifications in Blantyre, Malawi found a fall of 35.9% in the immediate COVID period, with 333 missed cases during the first wave (11). There has been little published regarding the impact of COVID-19 on typhoid case detection. In Madagascar, a 6.4-fold increase in typhoid intestinal perforations was observed in the 6 months following the onset of covid-19, attributed to delayed health-seeking behaviour. However, concerns regarding the impact of COVID-19 on typhoid have been highlighted; including the similar clinical presentation to COVID-19 with non-specific febrile illness, which may lead to delay or incorrect diagnosis and/ or treatment of typhoid, including increasing risks of antimicrobial resistance with the widespread use of azithromycin in COVID-19, particularly XDR strains (12).

We hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi has led to 1. Reduced typhoid detection secondary to: 2. Decreased healthcare facility attendances and subsequently a reduction blood culture collection. Our primary objective is: To quantify the number of missed typhoid cases following the COVID-19 pandemic, and secondary objective is to quantify the decline in health facility attendances and blood culture collection rates following the COVID-19 pandemic.

We need to check the dates for each COVID wave depending on the case count data from Malawi - Phil mentioned a data platform that has this done well. Also can check Phil's SARS-COV2 genomics pre-print for start of detection of each variant + Kondawni's papers - which dates did he use?

## iNTS vaccines

### Role of vaccines in iNTS disease control

Progress in controlling iNTS infections are hampered by non-specific clinical presentation, lack of accurate diagnostics, and incomplete knowledge of transmission pathways within the community and correlates of protection. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognises iNTS as a top-10 vaccine priority for Africa. A WHO Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Salmonella vaccination has recently been formed, with a strategic emphasis on Salmonella combination vaccines.(22) Puccini

There has been interest in obtaining better estimates for burden of NTS enterocolitis as this could add to the value of NTS vaccines. However, it is likely this has been overestimated [@crump2023]

### Vaccine efficacy in animal models

### Vaccines in development

There is no currently licensed vaccine available against iNTS disease. There are three iNTS vaccines that are in early clinical or pre-clinical development. One is a trivalent lipopolysaccharide-flagellin conjugate, targeting typhoid and the 2 commonest iNTS serovars in Africa (Typhimurium and Enteritidis) developed by the Centre for Vaccine Development, Baltimore, which is currently in Wellcome-Trust-funded Phase 1 clinical trials in the US and Mali (13). A second is another trivalent conjugate vaccine developed by the International Vaccine Institute (IVI) and supported by Wellcome Innovations an earlier pre-clinical stage of development. The third is a novel parenteral bivalent iNTS vaccine based on Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens (GMMA), also targeting serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis (14).

The leading candidate NTS vaccines that have commenced phase 2 studies include Generalised Modules of Membrane Antigen (GMMA) technology(23) and OAg/FliC conjugate(24), including bivalent (STm and SEn) and trivalent co-formulations (with TCV). All candidates present OAg and additional potential protein antigens.(22) PAiNTS will strategically leverage available data and samples from 3 ongoing phase 1&2 trials of GMMA-containing vaccines in adults and children, in endemic and non-endemic populations (Supplementary table F), by collaborative agreement with investigators, sponsors and funders.

### iNTS vaccine clinical trials and assessing vaccine efficacy

### Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM)

We have recently established an iNTS CHIM, to prospectively identify protective correlates after exposure/infection with a standardised infective dose.(21) The ongoing proof-of-principle study compares single-dose oral challenge using a well-characterised “African adapted” ST313 STm strain (D23580) against a “diarrhoeal” ST19 strain (4/74). Encouragingly, we have observed bacteraemia and persistent fever in our preliminary cohorts, alongside reliable rates of gastrointestinal carriage, indicating that this model will provide insights relevant to iNTS disease (Supplementary Panel E). In this proposal, we will move forward to an infection-reinfection challenge to establish evidence of protection following exposure/infection.

A well-designed CHIM study can play a strategic role in accelerating vaccine development. Notably, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation recommendation and pre-qualification of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV) was supported by CHIM data, and phase-3 efficacy studies for TCVs used anti-Vi IgG ELISA as their immunogenicity endpoint, generating further evidence for TCV introduction, despite uncertainties around its exact mechanistic role or final protective thresholds.(18,19) We aim to use the iNTS CHIM, combined with data from endemic settings, to build a scientific case for CoPs based on naturally-derived immunity. This will be aligned with vaccine-induced immunity to support vaccine licensure. \### Correlates of protection

Other vaccines licenced on correlates e.g. pneumo/ menigo SBA/IgG

### Co-correlates/ functional correlates

Correlates of Protection (CoP) are a key research gap identified in the new iNTS vaccine R&D Roadmap. The gold standard for vaccine licensure and policy decisions are double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials to determine vaccine efficacy with clinical endpoints. However, this can be prohibitively expensive and impractical, requiring very large sample sizes if the clinical endpoint is uncommon and expensive to diagnose, as is the case for iNTS. Immune Correlates of Protection (CoP) can accelerate the development of vaccines, providing non-clinical pivotal end points in vaccine studies (15, 16). CoP can be defined as immune markers shown to correlate statistically with a reduced risk of disease (17). CoPs have been key in licencing several vaccines, including meningococcal C conjugate vaccine in the UK in 1999, A serogroup A meningococcal polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine in India in 2009, and MenB-4C in Europe in 2013 (15). Sero-epidemiology studies are being used currently to identify an antibody CoP in GBS vaccination development (15).

Estimating an easily measured, robust antibody CoP, would be a key step accelerating any iNTS vaccine towards licensure and deployment.

The SaiNTS-Malawi study will expand upon the VacciNTS sero-epidemiology workpackage (WP7), in order to create CoP and epidemiological models that not only advance the development of GMMA vaccines, but also advance other vaccines in early pre-clinical and clinical development.

### VacciNTS consortium

GMMA has a unique and robust technical production platform uniquely suited to manufacture in a low income setting like Africa, and the VacciNTS consortium has recently been funded by a European Union H2020 grant, and aims to accelerate WHO prequalification and licensure of the vaccine, and position the vaccine for future phase 2 and 3 trials. The highly cost-effective GMMA-technology is based on outer membrane blebs released by genetically modified bacteria. Clinical proof-of-concept for the GMMA-technology was achieved with a Shigella sonnei vaccine in European and African adults. In animals, iNTS-GMMA were highly immunogenic and induced antibodies with bactericidal activity against African iNTS strains. Simple, robust and scalable manufacturing processes for iNTS-GMMA, suited for sSA, have been developed. Vacc-iNTS proposes GMP manufacturing of clinical lots followed by a two-stage Phase 1 trial in healthy European and African adults to investigate safety and immunogenicity of the iNTS-GMMA vaccine. Analysis include serum antibody levels and functionality, cellular responses, transcriptomics and data integration through a systems biology approach. Sero-epidemiological analysis will be conducted to provide essential data in preparation for future Phase 2 and 3 trials. Vacc-iNTS will also strengthen a collaborative network of iNTS experts from academia, industry and non-profit including partners from disease-endemic countries of sSA. The VacciNTS network will generate data to accelerate further vaccine development, enhance awareness, drive advocacy and vaccine deployment in limited-resources disease-endemic countries, tackling major roadblocks in advancing a vaccine against iNTS (figure 3).

Additionally, a series of work-packages (WP) aims to enable deployment and uptake in sub-Saharan countries where the burden of iNTS disease is greatest. These supporting activities include cross-sectional sero-epidemiological studies in potential future phase 2 and 3 clinical trial sites in Malawi, Ghana, Burkina Faso and Kenya (WP7); assessment of the global burden of disease using different risk-based modelling methodologies, and stakeholder engagement and advocacy activities (WP8); and assessments of the cost of iNTS illness and cost-effectiveness of iNTS vaccine introduction (WP9). GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health (GVGH) are providing the laboratory training and support for the sero-epidemiology studies.

The sero-epidemiology work package (WP7) is part of a larger body of work which aims to bridge the gap between pre-clinical and early clinical development of a novel vaccine against iNTS disease, based on GMMA (Generalised Modules for Membrane Antigens) technology. This work-package focuses on sero-epidemiological studies to aim to better understand serological prevalence and correlates of protection against iNTS in the community in Sub-Saharan Africa, to pave the way for early-phase field trials.

## Summary

There is therefore imperitive need for understanding epidemiology, accurate early diagnostics and prevention in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with disease (1). Further estimates of the NTS diarrhoeal burden in population-based child mortality surveys including Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network [@taylor2020], will be key to informing the added value of developing vaccines that protect against diarrhoeal disease in addition to invasive disease.
